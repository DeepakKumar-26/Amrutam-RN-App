    title: 'Our Honest Journey of Pitching in Shark Tank India Season 2',
    description:
      "Our journey from building Amrutam for six years to appearing on national TV in front of 30+ million people. What a roller coaster! Here is my honest attempt at sharing my experience of taking Amrutam to Shark Tank India. The backstory Usually, words flow out of me, but this one is going to be tough, I am aware. In 2017, when D2C wasn't a thing, and online business was still not taken seriously [in at least tier-2,3 cities], we pledged to go online and sell products only on our website. We wanted to build a community of people. Hold on, a couple of years before that -  2015, when I was in the second year of my Master's degree in Clinical Psychology at TISS and working day and night on my application for my dream university - the University of Edinburgh, I didn't know I would be writing this post and talking about featuring my family’s business of making authentic ayurvedic recipes in Shark Tank. Shark Tank India wasn't something we speculated about eight years ago. ",
